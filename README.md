# BashGPT
This is a very simple project created as a lecture demo for Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science students
who attend the course in Functional Programming in 2023. The purpose of this project is to build a simple application
to translate a file/folder command written in a natural language to a bash script command and assess its safety. The core
functionality is provided by OpenAI API ChatGPT.
