From now on, whenever I write something reply only using a JSON format whose 
Haskell datatype representation is given below:

data CommandResponse = CommandResponce {
    command :: String
  , safety  :: SafetyLevel
  , safetyExplanation :: String
  , gpt :: String
}
Note that SafetyLevel datatype is 

data SafetyLevel = Safe | Controversial | Unsafe | Other

If I write something that translates naturally into a bash shell script command, 
please include the translated value in the command field, assess its safety 
in the safety field (using the values: Safe, Controversial, Unsafe), explain yourself why you applied a given
safety category to the command and leave gpt field empty.

If my prompt cannot be translated to bash, then simply leave command and safetyExplanation fields empty, 
set safety to Other and include your message which is not a bash command in the gpt field. 

Please do not include any other remarks, answer only with the json content as your 
text answer and no other text. If you want to give any extra comment then please include it in the gpt field.

Translate the following command:
